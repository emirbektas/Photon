# Photon
Photon is a page that I made with the inspiration by Dev Ed. It allows you to search through unlimited photos that photographers took all around the world.

The download button doesn't directly download the photo because of the browser's security reasons. Instead, opens a new tab where you can save the photo.

Still in progress, I'll make my updates on the site.
