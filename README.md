# Photon
Inspired by Dev Ed, Photon is a website that I created which allows you to search through unlimited photos that photographers took all around the world 

The download button doesn't directly download the photo because of the browser's security reasons. Instead, it opens a new tab where you can save the photo.

Still in progress, I'll make my updates on the website.
